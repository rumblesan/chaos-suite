# Chaos Suite

A collection of useful modules for building chaotic systems, built for the 4U Loudest Warning format.

Based on some of the circuitry found on [Ian Fritz's site](https://ijfritz.byethost4.com/Chaos/ch_over.htm) and shared with his blessing.

Please don't go using this for any large scale commercial operations.

BOMs and layout guides can be found in the *build* folders within each project. If you're not sure about using git, then the simplest thing is to [Download](https://github.com/rumblesan/chaos-suite/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the entire thing as a zip file and get the files from that.

### Dual VC Integrator, Inverter and Non-Linearity

A pair of voltage controlled integrators with inverting and non-inverting inputs, as well as a separate inverter, and the `f(x) = x(1-x2)` non-linearity circuit used in a number of the chaos circuits.

### Dual Simple Integrator

A pair of basic integrators with inverted and non-inverted outputs.
